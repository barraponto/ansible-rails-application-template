## Ansible Rails Application-template

This is ansible playbook for creating rails app with doing some standard task.

#### motivation
To speed up initial development, RoR has the function of doing some routine job by writing pure ruby code(this function is named "application template"). But, I want to write it DSL like for more simplicity.
